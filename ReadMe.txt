Startup:
--------
1. Save galaxy_list.txt file to some folder.
    Example: c:\games\fh\
2. Create subdirectory 'reports' and put all your reports there.
    Example: c:\games\fh\reports\
3. Create subdirectory 'orders' and you can put your orders file there.
   FHUI will let you browse these orders from user interface, but this
   optional. FHUI will create another subdirectory there: FHUI.Data
   and will put its internal files there.
4. 
 Method 1:
   Copy FHUI binaries into your game directory (eg. c:\games\fh\)
   and just run it.
 Method 2:
   Put FHUI binaries in any folder, create shourtcut to run it
   and then edit the shortcut. Either set working directory to game data
   dir or add command line parameter: -dir <your_fh_dir>
     Example: -dir c:\games\fh\
5. Have fun using FHUI :)
