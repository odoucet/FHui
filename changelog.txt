This is a change log for FHUI releases.
Major new features and bug fixes will be listed here.
Minor changes are listed only if originally requested by player
* Bug fixes
+ New features
[P] denotes player requested features

FHUI build 302
* [P] Fixed crashes while sorting Aliens tab.
* Fixed saving orders template to file.
* Update tooltip after changing commands order for any phase.
* Fixed CU/IU/AU values for Install command edit.
* Fixed some grids and commands update issues when changing current turn display.
+ New commands supported: Build Inventory (PD, Hi-Tech items).
+ Ships built in given turn may be immediately used as targets for
  building iu/cu/au, develop and transfer commands. Post-arrival orders
  for such ships are also available.
+ Changes to colonies summary row: Size column now shows sum of colony sizes
  instead of average size. LSN and PR% columns show weighted average so bigger
  colonies have stronger impact on calculation.
+ "Jump here" context menu available for any planet (previously only named planets).
+ In row selection mode selected rows are preserved after sorting, filters, tech
  levels or reference system change.
+ Improved color generator for wormhole endpoints for Systems tab.
+ New column "Met" on Aliens tab showing in which turn you met this species.
  There may be species known only via diplomacy (turn 0) and for such aliens
  context menu doesn't show command options.
+ Number of used shipyards tracking added to orders template generator.
  Budget/resources/shipyards warnings are displayed in red color.

FHUI build 288
* Issued post-arrival transfer commands did not appear in ships' context menu.

FHUI build 287
* [P] Fixed crash when displaying context menu for newly named planet
  on Colonies tab.
* [P] Fixed cost of Hide command.
* Fixed possible crash or incorrect menu update when deleting ship commands.
+ New commands supported: Transfer.
+ Any unrecognized order present in report's orders template section
  will be loaded as a custom order.
+ Additional reports now allowed for any turn, not only "turn 0".
  You can use it for example to store estimates aquired via diplomacy
  and still see valid turn number in FHUI.
+ Planets tab: "Show planets in alien home systems" filter added.
+ Colonies tab: Summary row added that displays summaries for owned colonies.
  See tooltip for each cell for details. Summary row may be disabled
  by a checkbox on toolbar.
+ Colonies/Ships inventory display: now the inventory/cargo columns show
  inv/cargo state for the end of production turn. It means it includes any changes
  caused by recycle/production and pre-departure transfer commands.
  Original colony inventory/ship cargo from the status report is always available
  via the tooltip.

FHUI build 267
* Fixed bug that did not allow custom pre-departure commands for
  ships without any cargo.
* Fixed bug that did not allow FHUI to load custom commands with
  negative cost (recycle).
* Fixed bug that allowed exceeding colony planet budget after generating
  many EUs by a big recycle command.
+ New commands supported: Install, Orbit, Move.
+ Commands management menu added to Systems tab. Custom orders
  now possible for Combat, Pre-Departure, Post-Arrival and Strikes
  phases independent of colonies and ships.
+ Any command may be edited as custom command (excluding ship
  jumps commands).
+ Build CU/IU/AU with ship target: limit amount of units built
  to ship's capacity.
+ Option to save orders template directly to file from Orders tab
  context menu. Orders will be saved to file orders/FHUI_orders_tNNN.txt.

FHUI build 251
* [P] Fixed recycle command for ships.
* Fixed wormhole target printing on Ships tab/Jump column.
* Fixed 'Cancel All' commands menus for non-production phases.

+ Custom commands added for colonies and ships. You can enter
  any command you want.
+ Reload button now has two options: reload all and reload reports
  without losing commands.
+ Develop command dialog: display TR jumping to developing system as
  potential develop target ship.
+ Systems tab: mark matching wormhole terminus endpoints with colors.
+ Planets tab: mark empty planets in alien home system with brighter
  alien color.
+ Colonies tab: include LS changes on toolbar when calculating colony
  production and production penalty. This is useful for production
  simulation at given tech levels.
+ Aliens tab: Message column format changed to:
  S: last sent msg turn nr, R: last recv msg turn nr.
  If you prepare new message in current turn "Send NEW" will appear.
  If you receive a new message in last turn, this will be marked as
  "(New)" and cell will be displayed in red.
+ Ships commands menu reorganized to be similar to the one on Colonies tab.
+ Ships tab: mark misjumped ships' location with red color.
+ Rows/Cells selection mode is saved for future FHUI sessions.
+ Planet after naming is treated as colony with zero size.
+ It is now possible to edit already added Research command.

FHUI build 226
* [P] Localization independent string formatting when generating scans.
* Scan file is exported to data directory instead of working directory.
+ Splitting "turn 0" content into several files is now allowed.
+ Build Cu/Iu/Au: it is now possible to specify target for build command
  and edit already added command.
+ Filters changed:
  On Systems Visited/Not visited replaced with Known/Unknown (scanned or not).
  On Planets tab: visited/not visited removed, it did not make sense.
  On Colonies tab: Show allied/neutral/enemy colonies filter added.

FHUI build 217
* Fixed minor bug in comments for production orders - budget calculation.
+ New commands supported: Develop, Visited.
+ Production/Cancel All menu option now requires confirmation before
  deleting all orders.
+ Automation menu: new option to delete all production Auto commands
  (leaves scouting, installs, etc.).
+ New column on Systems tab: Jmp - shows ship or number of ships
  jumping to this system in current turn. Full list of ships with
  current location and mishap chance printed in tooltip.
+ Aliens tab may now show alien's atmospheric information. Since this
  info can only be obtained via diplomacy, you have to put it into
  one of your reports in format:
  INFO SP species_name; Home:[11 22 33 9] Temp:55 Press:66  Atm:XX 10-20% Poisons: XX,YY,ZZ
  DON'T miss the semicolon after species name!!!
  The "Home:[...]" section is optional.
  For your convenience, ask your friend to share the data in format
  presented by FHUI in the side bar. You just have to remove new lines
  from that string, add the INFO SP prefix.
+ New column on Planets tab: AlienLSN. This column is by default hidden,
  to make it display useful data use context menu/Show Alien LSN and
  select species to show. You must have the full atmospheric data about
  the species for this to work.
+ Systems tab has new 'Export Scans...' context menu. It saves scans of
  selected systems to scans.txt file in game folder. This is useful for
  sharing diplomatic data. This option works only in ROW selection mode.
  Your LSN is replaced with 99 in all saved scans.
+ "Dist.Prev" column added on Systems, Planets, Colonies and Ships tabs.
  This is distance to previous reference system that was active before
  switching to another one. This column is by default not visible.
  To show or hide it latter right click the grid header with column names.
+ New context menu option on Systems tab: "Mark as Visited". This is available
  for systems that you did not yet visit yourself, but for example received
  scan via diplomacy and don't want your scouts to go there.
  This generates 'Visited' order in orders template.

FHUI build 202
* Fixed bug: hang when production orders/cancel all option selected.
* Fixed support for Install command generated from Auto.
* Develop Auto command still not fully supported, but it is now
  removed by 'Delete all Auto commans' option and develops are
  placed last after the list of other orders.
  Next FHUI release will fully support Develop command.
+ Changed filters reset on Planets tab to set Max LSN to 99 instead of
  player's current LS level.
+ Moved Message command to Post-Arrival phase. Application warns you if
  message contains 'Zzz' line.

      but the planet is not yet colonized.

  see ship's jump order and still be able to see other orders.
